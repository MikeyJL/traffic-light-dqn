Setup
-----
1. Install SUMO onto your system. Please follow the installation guide here and follow the instructions strictly: https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html
2. Create a new python environment in this project using 'python -m venv <ENVIRONMENT NAME>'
3. Activate the new environment using 'source <ENVIRONMENT NAME>/bin/activate'
4. Install all dependencies using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
5. You are ready to run the project, use 'python src/main.py' to run the default configuration. Else, you can use 'python src/main.py -h' to bring up the help menu for the custom CLI.

IMPORTANT: If you wish to use GUI for the simulation, you must follow additional steps to install XQuartz. Else, don't use the --gui flag and stick with the command-line version.

Docker Setup
------------

If you decided to use Docker instead, then this is the quickest way to run this project. First you need to download Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

This will get you the CLI for Docker. Then in the terminal and in the project root.

1. Run 'docker build -t traffic-dqn .'
2. Wait for the build to finish
3. Run 'docker run traffic-dqn'
4. You should see the project running with the default setting to start training. You will see logs of episodes being completed and the performance matrix for each.
